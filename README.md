# Predicting Greenhouse Gas Emissions with Machine Learning and Data Analysis

## Project Overview
As 2022 unfolded, a clear pathway of climate hope emerged. New policy breakthroughs have the potential to unlock enormous progress in the effort to slow and reverse warming temperatures. Encouraging developments from a very momentous year, as nation after nation elected more climate-oriented governments and enacted new efforts to curb greenhouse gas. in August the Biden administration and a narrow Democratic majority in Congress managed to pass the Inflation Reduction Act. 

This new U.S. law, backed by some $374 billion in climate spending, is the country's most aggressive piece of climate legislation ever. Its provisions ensure that for decades to come billions of dollars will roll toward the energy transition, making it easier to deploy renewable energy, build out green technologies and subsidize consumer adoption of everything from electric cars to heat pumps. Experts on energy modeling predict the law will eliminate 4 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions.

For our project, we have an investor that would like to tap into the climate spending but doesn't know what sector or location to start. We will be utilizing the Climate Change Data from the World Bank for our database. It is data from World Development Indicators and Climate Change Knowledge Portal on climate systems, exposure to climate impacts, resilience, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy use. We will be using a machine learning model for predicting CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth indicatiors like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population, and energy use per capita. We will be analyzing greenhouse gas emissions by the following:

- General
  - What countries have the largest CO2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)?
  - What are the GHG emissions per country?
- Machine Learning: 
  - Can a machine learning model show that there is a correlation between factors that may influence CO2 emissions?
- Factors influencing emissions: 
  - How does CO2 emissions change year over year?
  - How does GDP influence CO2 emissions? 
  - How does population influence CO2 emissions? 
- USA Data: 
  - Which state and city has the most CO2 emissions?
  - What sector generates the most CO2 emissions?
  - What cities contribute to the CO2 emissions' sectors?

##  Results
### Database
We used a python library(wbgapi) that fetches World Bank Data directly into the dataframe using API. Pandas is used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. The data is then loaded into a local PostGres database. Postgres(SQL) is the database we intend to use, and the structure of the database is designed using the QuickDBD tool. We will eventually run the database in AWS.

#### Data Extraction:
- The data for the project is extracted from the World bank database. Though, there are several ways to retrieve the dataset, Pythonâ€™s WBGAPI is chosen because of the ease of data retrieval and availability of current data.

### Machine Learning
#### Data preprocessing
- Unnecessary columns (like country) are dropped from the retrieved data.
- After ensuring there are no duplicates, the column headers of the dataset are renamed.
- Missing values per year are detected and years with a fair amount of data are considered for further analysis. The same logic is used to filter country data.
- The skew is addressed by using a cuberoot transformer.
- The model reads data from the database into a Pandas data frame.
- The model tests the hypothesis whether CO2 emissions depend on country-specific features (such as energy use, population metrics, GDP, cereal yield, etc. ) available in the dataset and can be predicted from these.
- The dataset has three dependent variables that predict emissions.
- Upon plotting correlation matrix, emissions_per_capita is chose as label as this is correlated to many independent variables.
- It is observed that the skew has reduced in the data distribution. Though not all features are fairly symmetric.
- Correlation matrix plotted after handling skewness showed increase in relation coefficients compared to original data. My dominant features are the 
- The Label and features are then determined.

- The training and testing data are split in 70:30 ratio.
- CO2 emissions per capita shows both linear dependency and non-linear relationships with features plotted.
- Since there are multiple independent variables that may predict emissions, a **Correlation** matrix is generated to reduce and interpret data.
- **CO<sub>2</sub> emissions_per_capita is considered target variable** as this is correlated to several predicting variables.
- A correlation value of 0.5 is set as threshold to select the features: Energy use per capita, GDP per capita, GNI per capita, Urban Population %, Electricity Access %, Cereal Yield.
- Later, each selected feature is visualized with the target variable. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita shows a strong linear dependency to Energy use per capita and non-linear relationships with rest of the features.
- Since features exhibit both linear and non-linear relationship with CO2 emissions per capita, Machine Learning algorithms that can handle non-linearities like DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor are trained.
- The DecisionTreeRegressor seems to handle skewness of data better.
- Grid search is the simplest algorithm is implemented for Hyper Parameter Tuning.
- The model did not show improvement after Hyper Parameter Tuning.

## Summary and Recommendations for the Dashboard
### Workflow: 
The cleaned data from the database is used to create visualizations. The dashboard is an interactive  web application which showcases seamless integration of Tableau and Plotly visuals.

#### Tableau
- After bringing in our CSV files, we chose various forms of graphs and maps to show the relationship between CO2 emissions and various factors such as GDP per capita, population growth, fossil usage, etc. 
- We also used various forms of filtering (by Year, Top 10 countries etc) to allow for a more comprehensive study of the charts provided. 
- We used the Actions option in Tableau Dashboard, to include interactive selection and filtering elements to our visualization.

![actions](https://github.com/sahithig1/capstone_greenhouse_emissions/blob/main/Dashboard%20Images/Creating%20actions.png)

- Through our dashboard, we will be able to dive into some visualizations to help our investors grasp the concepts of Green House Gas emissions and their effects on the environment. 

=======
#### Plotly:
- HTML, CSS and Bootstrap are extensively used to build the layout of the dashboard page. 
- The dashboard also houses plots built with Python's Plotly.
- The Tableau visualizations are embedded into the web page using Tableau Embedding API. 

#### Analysis 
At first glance, we can see that TX is the largest CO2 emitter in the country, followed by LA. 
When we click on the TX bar in the bar graph, we can see how these emissions are spread out over the various sectors. Chemicals sector is the highest contributor.
![TX1](https://github.com/sahithig1/capstone_greenhouse_emissions/blob/main/Dashboard%20Images/Statewise_Emissions_TX.png)

We also notice the the Chemical sector is the highest contributing sector for CO2 emission in LA. 
![LA1](https://github.com/sahithig1/capstone_greenhouse_emissions/blob/main/Dashboard%20Images/Statewise_Emissions_LA.png)

As the first step to our analysis, we can assume that Texas and Louisiana are high on our priority list of states needing assistance in cutting down their CO2 emissions, especially in the Chemicals sector.

![LA2](https://github.com/sahithig1/capstone_greenhouse_emissions/blob/main/Dashboard%20Images/Analysis_state_sector_LA.png)

We may need to look into the companies that emit the highest amounts of CO2 and see if they would be a good match for this investment goal.

#### Future visualization and improvement: 

- Creating individual dropdown menu for each factor (Energy Use, Urban Population Growth and GDP) in the Factor tab.
