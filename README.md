# Working Title: Predicting and Analyzing Greenhouse Gas Emmissions

## Project Overview
The damage caused by climate change over this past year was at times so immense it was hard to comprehend. In Pakistan alone, extreme summer flooding killed thousands, displaced millions and caused over $40 billion in losses. Fall floods in Nigeria killed hundreds and displaced over 1 million people. Droughts in Europe, China and the U.S. dried out once-unstoppable rivers and slowed the flows of commerce on major arteries like the Mississippi and the Rhine.

As 2022 unfolded, a clear pathway of climate hope emerged. New policy breakthroughs have the potential to unlock enormous progress in the effort to slow and reverse warming temperatures. Encouraging developments from a very momentous year, as nation after nation elected more climate-oriented governments and enacted new efforts to curb greenhouse gas. in August the Biden administration and a narrow Democratic majority in Congress managed to pass the Inflation Reduction Act. 

This new U.S. law, backed by some $374 billion in climate spending, is the country's most aggressive piece of climate legislation ever. Its provisions ensure that for decades to come billions of dollars will roll toward the energy transition, making it easier to deploy renewable energy, build out green technologies and subsidize consumer adoption of everything from electric cars to heat pumps. Experts on energy modeling predict the law will eliminate 4 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions.

For our project, we will be using a machine learning regression model for predicting CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth indicatiors like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population, and energy use per capita. We will be analyzing greenhouse gas emissions by the following:
- Per capita: how much CO2 does the average person emit?
- What are the countries’ annual CO2 emissions?
- Year-on-year change: what is the percentage change in CO2 emissions?
- Cumulative: how much CO2 has it produced to date?
- What share of global CO2 emissions are emitted by the country?
- Total greenhouse gas emissions: how much does the average person emit? Where do emissions come from? 

## Communication protocols
We are utilizing our Slack group project channel to relay information to each other. We have divided the project by presentation, GitHub, Machine Learning Model, Database and Dashboard. We created branches for each deliverable and will use that branch for our portion of the project. When we are ready for pull requests to be approved, we will indicate via Slack that we are ready for the person in charge of Github to act accordingly. We are meeting 3 times a week to collaborate and ensure we are answering each others' questions. 

## Project Outline
- Presentation: Content, Google Slides, Live Presentation
- Github: Main Branch, README.md, Individual Branches
- Machine Learning Model: Working code or their machine learning model
  - Description of data preprocessing 
  - Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including the team's decision-making process 
  - Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
  - Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
  - Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables)
  - Description of how model was trained (or retrained, if they are using an existing model)
  - Description and explanation of model’s confusion matrix, including final accuracy score
